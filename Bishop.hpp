     * @pre The row & col members of the Bishop object match its actual position on the passed board object.
     * 
     * The Bishop's movement follows these rules:
     * 1. The Bishop may move any number of squares diagonally from its current position
     * 2. The path to the target square must be unobstructed by (ie. contain) other pieces, 
     *      except for the target square itself.
     * 3. The target square must either be empty (moving) or contain a piece of another color (capturing)
     * 4. The target square must stay within the board's bounds, ie. not outside [0, BOARD_LENGTH)
     * 5. The Bishop cannot move to its currently occupied position (i.e. it can't stand still).
     * 
     * @param target_row An integer representing the row index of the target square on the board.
     * @param target_col An integer representing the column index of the target square on the board.
     * @param board A 2D vector representing the current board state, 
     *              where each cell points to a ChessPiece object or is null.
     * 
     * @return True if the Bishop can move to the specified position; false otherwise.
